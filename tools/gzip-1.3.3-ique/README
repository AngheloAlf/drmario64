This repository contains a cut-down version of gzip 1.3.3 that produces
matching compression for iQue versions of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina
of Time. Decompression is not included; any compliant DEFLATE implementation
will work for matching decompression, just use an up-to-date zlib.

The front-end of the program has been rewritten, supporting only a small
subset of the original:

`gzip [-V] [-v] [-[0-9]] <ifilename> <ofilename>`

where
 - `V` prints the program version
 - `v` is the verbose toggle
 - `0-9` is the compression level
